So you originally have your error function:
E = 1/2 * (y - t)^2
d/dy = 2(y-t)/2 = y-t
And you want to find your partial derivatives of error for all the variables in:
score = w1 * x1 + w2 * x2 + b

So what you need to do is use the chain rule, which says that if a function is dependent on another, and you want to
make a partial derivative from those, then use the chain rule.
So, in our case, the function E is depending on the values in the function score, so we need to use the chain rule.
The chain rule is:
d p(q(z))/dz = (dp/dq) * (dq/dz)
which makes the dq's cancel out, leaving dp/dz

So here are our values:
q = y - t
p = 1/2 * (q^2)
so our partial derivative dp/dq = (y-t)

dq/dz:
# q = y - t
However, in our other function, q is different and corresponds to:
q = y = A(z) --> our normalized score

Now the reason we need to redo it is because (y-t) is a function that was contained within the E function. Thus, we need to do it once to get (y-t) and then again with respect to y to give us y' which is A'(z).

Then we need to do the partial derivative from the perspective of w1 of our score function, which gives us x1. Thus, it gives us:
(y-t)*A'(z)*x1 = d/dw1
